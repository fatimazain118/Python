#-->tell() function. f.tell() returns an integer giving the file pointer current position in the file represented as a number of bytes. File Pointer/File Handler
is like a cursor,which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. 
Return Value:  seek() function returns the current position of the file pointer within the file.

f= open("tut27.txt")
print(f.tell())         #it tells where is the file pointer
print(f.readline())
print(f.tell())
print(f.readline())       #print file line by line
print(f.tell())

seek() function--> When we open a file, the system points to the beginning of the file. Any read or write will happen from the start. To change the file objectâ€™s position, use seek(offset, whence) function.
The position will compute by adding offset to a reference point, and the whence argument selects the reference point. It is useful when operating over an open file. 
Syntax:  file_pointer .seek(offset, whence).
Offset:   In seek() function, offset is required. Offset is the position of the read/write pointer within the file.
Whence: This is optional. It defines the point of reference. The default is 0, which means absolute file positioning.


f= open("tut27.txt")
print(f.readline())            #read first line of file
f.seek(4)                      #start reading again from given offset
print(f.readline())            #then printed it
