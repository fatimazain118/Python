#The string is a data type in Python. Strings in Python programming language are arrays of bytes representing a sequence of characters. In simple terms, Strings are 
the combination or collection of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings are one of the most used data types in any programming language because most of the real-world 
data such as name, address, or any sequence which contains alphanumeric characters are mostly of type ‘String’.

'''Primarily, you will find three types of strings in Python :

Single Quote String – (‘Single Quote String’)
Double Quote String – (“Double Quote String”)
Triple Quote String – (‘’’ Triple Quote String ‘’’)
'''
#In Python, the term ‘string slice’ refers to a part of the string, where strings are sliced using a range of indices.
#To do string slicing, we just need to put the name of the string followed by [n:m]. It means ‘n’ denotes the index from which slicing should start, and ‘m’ denotes 
the index at which slicing should terminate or complete.



mystr="hello Zainab"
print(mystr)
print(mystr[1])
print(mystr[0:1]) #In string slicing 0 is included but 1 excluded
print(mystr[0:2])
print(len(mystr))
# print(mystr(34)) #shows error
print(mystr[0:45]) #dont show error
print(mystr[0:5:2]) #from 0 to 4(excluding 5) print alternatively as 2 is given so leave 1 character
print(mystr[0::2])
print(mystr[:2]) #bydefault it will take starting 0
print(mystr[0:]) #by default take ending of full lenghth
print(mystr[::]) #by default last wala bhi khali chrra to 1 aaiga
print(mystr[-4:-2])  #From back it'll count                                                            
print(mystr[8:10])  #Same as above in +ve no.
print(mystr[::-1])  #Reverse the string
print(mystr[::-2])  #Reserve and skip one character
print(mystr.isalpha())   #is alpha is a function which check it's alpha as it contain spaces
var = "hiiiZainab"
print(var.isalpha())  #return true coz no no space
print(mystr.isalnum())
print(mystr.endswith("Zainab"))
print(mystr.count("Z"))
print(mystr.capitalize())
print(mystr.find("hello"))   #from 0 index its starting
print(mystr.upper())
print(mystr.replace("hello", "hi"))
