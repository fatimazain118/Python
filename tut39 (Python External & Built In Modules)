In Python, a module can be defined as a file containing a runnable python code. The extension used by modules in Python is .py. Hence any simple file containing Python code
can be considered as a module if its extension is .py. The file and module names are the same; hence we can call a module only by name without using the extension.

There are two types of modules.

Built-in
External

Built-in Modules:
Built-in modules are already installed in Python by default. We can import a module in Python by using the import statement along with the specific module name. 

External modules:
External modules have to be downloaded externally; they are not already present like the built-in ones. Installing them is a rather easy task and can be done by using the command
“pip install module_name” in the compiler terminal.

Python provides us with a lot of modules that make our coding much easy because we do not have to write all the code ourselves. We can directly access a module for a specific task
___________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 import random                 //importing module

random_number = random.randint(0,6)             //randint is a function inside our imported module
print(random_number)                    #generates random no.

lst = ["star plus", "zee tv", "sony"]
choice = random.choice(lst)
print(choice)
