	Object-oriented programming is the problem-solving approach. The computation is done by using objects.
  	OOP provides a proper way for data hiding.
    In object-oriented programming, the program splits into self-contained objects. Each object represents a different part of the application which can communicate among
    themselves.
    
    A class is a collection of objects, and an object is defined as an instance of a class possessing attributes.
    A class has all the similar attributes, like if we have a class students, then it will only consist of students' related data, such as subjects, names, attendance ratio, etc
    
    By using oop, we can divide our code into many sections known as classes. Each class holds a distinct purpose or usage.
    There is no limit to the number of classes we can create in a program. Also, one class can be easily accessible by another, and we can also restrict the access of a class
    so other classes can not use its functions.
