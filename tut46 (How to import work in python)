A common mistake that most of the beginners do is, why canâ€™t we name our file, the same as the name of a module. The reason is associated with the path. When we give our file
a name same as the name of a module, then instead of importing the original module, the system will import our created file because it starts its search for the file from
the directory where the file we are working on exists. So, we will not be able to use the functions of the original file.

import file2tut46
print(file2tut46.a)
______________________________
****Output********
7        # file2tut46 is a another python file having a=7
___________________________________________________________________

from file2tut46 import a
print(a)                                       #we dont import like this as its not good programmer practice because import "a" can be from different file agar file3 me bhi "a" 
                                                      hua uska bhi import hojaiga
                                                      
file2tut46.print_joke("This is for calling")     #like this we can use functions of another python file by just importing them
