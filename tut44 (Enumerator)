“ An enumerate is a built-in function that provides an index to data structure elements, making iterations through them easier and simpler.” 
many methods that print items of different data structures onto the screen. For these kinds of operations, we need to have a for loop along with an iterator and an integer
variable in which we have to increment every time the loop runs. Well, python provides us with a simple and easy solution to deal with certain situations by providing us with
a built-in function known as “enumerate function.” Using the enumerate function, we can summarize the code and make it easier and simpler to use.

What enumerate function does is, it assigns an index to every element or value in the object that we want to iterate, so we do not have to assign a specific variable for
incremental function, instead we have to apply a for loop, and our function will start working. Its syntax is a lot simpler and shorter than what we have been following till now.

Syntax
enumerate(iterable, start=0)


for index, item in enumerate(list):               #no need to declare i
    if index%2 ==0:                               #i is starting frm 0 and we need odd no. digits
       print(f"John please bring {item}")

***********Output***********
John please bring Bhindi                       #output is same as using for loop like above
John please bring sugar
