What is Abstraction?
Abstraction refers to hiding unnecessary details to focus on the whole product instead of parts of the project separately. It is a mechanism that represents the important
features without including implementation details.

 In programming, abstraction can not be achieved without Encapsulation.

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation means hiding under layers. When working with classes and handling sensitive data, global access to all the variables used in the program is not secure. 
In Encapsulation, the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from the outside to secure the data. It improves the maintainability of an application and helps
the developers to organize the code better.

Abstraction focuses on what the object does instead of how the details are implemented.
Encapsulation focuses on hiding the code and data into a single unit to secure the data from the outside world.
